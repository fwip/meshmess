# meshmess

this project is a mess. and hopefully one day, a computational mesh. :)

## goals

To model all computation as a series of functional transformations on immutable data, and to provide a platform to build on or modify those computations.

## technology

haha, oh jeez. Nothing yet. The plan is to start with the concepts of event-sourcing, or lambda/kappa architecture. [kappa-db](https://github.com/kappa-db/kappa-core) is a big inspiration.

## roadmap

The roughest of roadmaps:

- [ ] A prototype that allows computation of state from data or other derived state
- [ ] sharing data or functions over a p2p network
- [ ] demo applications, like a tiny twitter clone
- [ ] incorporate principles of verifiable computing where possible
- [ ] rich visualizations of dataflow - from raw data to derived state
- [ ] meshmess in the presentation layer
- [ ] DSL for ad-hoc queries (think SQL)
